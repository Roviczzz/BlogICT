Aspiring to be a photographer and an artist. My hobbies are, of course, taking pictures of beautiful views, practicing instruments, reading books, and listening to music. 

                            I have so many goals that I want to accomplish but one of the main goals I want to do first is graduate college. I know it will be a tough road to ride through, nevertheless, it's not about the end of the road, it's about the journey itself. Another goal I want to do is to travel to different countries, see different pulchritudinous sights and views, and capture those moments into art. And lastly, find true happiness in life.

                            <h2 class="mb-3" data-aos="fade-up">The Life of an ICT Student</h2>

                            <p data-aos="fade-up">
                               For me, the life of an ICT student is like the beautiful waves of the ocean, sometimes it gets stormy, sometimes it's calm, and sometimes it's still. Programming takes practice, focus, patience, hardwork, and creativity to make a masterpiece. It's like art but in codes. You type in the paint, every stroke and brush is like every code that you put in. Every mistake is just a chance of making it into a full functioning app. 


                            </p>

                            <p data-aos="fade-up">
                                Programming is a step-by-step process, each step you take will be harder and harder but a new lesson will always be learned in those steps. As the saying goes "Practice makes perfect". I like learning new things, new lessons in each mishaps come in the way. 
                            </p>

                            <h2 class="mb-3" data-aos="fade-up">Advices for future ICT Students</h2>

                            <p data-aos="fade-up">
                               Word of advice for the future ICT students out there, just have fun in each problem you encounter, learning shouldn't be a burden but a process of testing what are you're capabilities. There will be times that will make you feel heavy and hopeless, but in those times, is an opportunity for you to get up and stand strong. "Don't shoot for the target but shoot up above the stars in the sky, aim higher, sÅ«n zi." That's what always my grandfather would say to me. So in short, have fun and be creative and always think outside the box.
